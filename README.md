# Youth SRH Access Gaps and Equity Analysis Across Selected Nigerian States
## Objective
The objective of this analysis was to identify gaps in youth sexual and reproductive health (SRH) service access across **age group, gender, geography,** and service type, **in order to inform targeted demand generation, outreach strategies, and equity-focused programming.**
The project demonstrates how routine program data can be transformed into **decision-ready insights** for adaptive SRH programming.

- **5 states:** Kano, Lagos, Nasarawa, Niger, Plateau
- **15 LGAs**
- **Youth population aged 15–24**
- **Service types:**
- HIV Testing

## Interpretation
Younger adolescents face higher access barriers, particularly for contraceptive services and counseling, likely due to stigma, provider bias, and limited youth-friendly service points.
