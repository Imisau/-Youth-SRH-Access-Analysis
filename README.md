# Youth SRH Access Gaps and Equity Analysis Across Selected Nigerian States
## Objective
The objective of this analysis was to identify gaps in youth sexual and reproductive health (SRH) service access across **age group, gender, geography,** and service type, **in order to inform targeted demand generation, outreach strategies, and equity-focused programming.**
The project demonstrates how routine program data can be transformed into **decision-ready insights** for adaptive SRH programming.

# Data Description
## Data Source
**A synthetic program dataset (n = 1,000)** modeled on key indicators from **NDHS and NHMIS,** covering:
- **5 states:** Kano, Lagos, Nasarawa, Niger, Plateau
- **15 LGAs**
- **Youth population aged 15–24**
- **Service types:**
- HIV Testing
- STI Treatment
- Contraceptive Provision
- Family Planning (FP) Counseling
# Key Indicators Included
- Service uptake and non-service rates
- Gender access differentials
- Rural–urban access gaps
- State-level service uptake rates

# Key Findings

## Geographic Inequities (Rural vs Urban)
![](https://github.com/Imisau/-Youth-SRH-Access-Analysis/blob/main/Geo_inequality.png)
## Key Drivers of Rural Non-Service:
- Commodity stockouts
- Limited provider availability
- Distance to facilities
- Heightened stigma for adolescents, especially females
Rural LGAs account for a **disproportionate share of unmet access,** despite comparable levels of need.

## Age-Based Access Gaps
Adolescents aged 15–19 experience significantly lower access to SRH services compared to youth aged 20–24.
Age Group	Percent Not Served

## Interpretation
Younger adolescents face higher access barriers, particularly for contraceptive services and counseling, likely due to stigma, provider bias, and limited youth-friendly service points.
Outreach Effectiveness: Community-based channels outperform facility-based services in reaching rural adolescents, especially for the 15–19 age group.
## Gender-Based Service Uptake
Across all service types, **female youth accessed services more frequently than males,** but this does not eliminate gender inequities—especially among adolescent girls in rural areas.
Service Type	Male	Female
![](https://github.com/Imisau/-Youth-SRH-Access-Analysis/blob/main/Gender_base_service_uptake.png)
## Gender Access Gap: -0.03
- Indicates a slight disadvantage for males overall
- Masks deeper barriers for female adolescents, particularly stigma-driven non-service in rural LGAs

## Service Uptake by State
![](https://github.com/Imisau/-Youth-SRH-Access-Analysis/blob/main/service_uptake_state.png)
## Insights:
- **Kano** shows the lowest uptake, suggesting compounded barriers related to settlement patterns, provider availability, and social norms.
•	States with stronger outreach and urban infrastructure (Lagos, Niger) perform relatively better.

# Outreach Effectiveness
![](https://github.com/Imisau/-Youth-SRH-Access-Analysis/blob/main/map_outreach_effectiveness.png)
Community-based delivery channels outperform facility-based services in:
- **Rural LGAs**
- **Adolescents aged 15–19**
This is particularly evident for **FP counseling and contraceptive provision,** where facilities remain underutilized by younger adolescents.

# Summary Indicators
- **Total Youth Reached:** 1,000
- **Unmet Need:** 0.00 (modeled dataset)
- **Key Equity Risks Identified:**
1 Age (15–19)
2 Rural residence
3 Female adolescents facing stigma
  
# Programmatic Implications
## Priority Actions
1 **Scale Community-Based Outreach**
- Focus on high-gap rural LGAs
- Target adolescents aged 15–19
2 **Strengthen FP Commodity Logistics**
- Reduce stockout-driven non-service
- Improve last-mile distribution in rural settlements
3 **Integrate Peer Educator Models**
- Address stigma affecting female adolescents
- Increase acceptability of SRH services
4 **Improve Provider Availability**
- Task shifting and mobile outreach in low-coverage LGAs
5 **Institutionalize Equity Dashboards**
- Track age, gender, and rural–urban gaps routinely
- Support adaptive programming and real-time decision-making

# Decision Value of the Analysis
This portfolio project demonstrates the ability to:
- Apply health systems and equity lenses to routine SRH data
- Identify hidden access gaps masked by aggregate coverage
- Translate analytics into clear programmatic actions
- Support donor reporting, state planning, and adaptive management
